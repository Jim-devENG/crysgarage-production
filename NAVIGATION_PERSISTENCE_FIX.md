# Navigation Persistence Fix - Crys Garage

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved

**Issue**: Users reported that when navigating through the Professional tier pages (back and forth using browser navigation), files were being lost and they had to reload the page to continue the process. Sometimes the application would even shut down completely.

**Additional Issue**: Browser back/forward navigation was causing crashes and the application would shut down.

## âœ… Solution Implemented

### **IndexedDB-Powered File Persistence + Browser Navigation Fix**

Implemented a robust file persistence system using IndexedDB to ensure uploaded files survive browser navigation, page reloads, and even browser restarts. Additionally, fixed browser navigation crashes by implementing proper state management and event handling.

### **Key Features Added:**

1. **Persistent File Storage**
   - Files are automatically saved to IndexedDB when uploaded
   - Files persist across browser sessions and page reloads
   - Automatic cleanup when user starts a new session

2. **Smart State Restoration**
   - On page load, automatically restores the last uploaded file
   - Maintains user's progress through the workflow
   - Graceful fallback to step 1 if file restoration fails

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Handles IndexedDB failures gracefully
   - Validates file metadata before restoration
   - Automatic cleanup of corrupted state

4. **Browser Navigation Fix**
   - Prevents multiple state restoration attempts
   - Handles browser back/forward buttons gracefully
   - Shows loading state during restoration
   - Prevents crashes during navigation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Storage Architecture:**
```
SessionStorage: State metadata (current step, genre, etc.)
IndexedDB: Actual file blobs
```

### **File Flow:**
1. **Upload** â†’ File saved to IndexedDB + metadata to SessionStorage
2. **Navigation** â†’ State preserved in SessionStorage
3. **Page Reload** â†’ File restored from IndexedDB using metadata
4. **New Session** â†’ All data cleared from both storages

### **Browser Navigation Handling:**
1. **Before Unload** â†’ Save current state to storage
2. **Pop State** â†’ Handle back/forward navigation events
3. **Component Mount** â†’ Restore state only once with loading indicator
4. **Error Recovery** â†’ Fallback to clean state if restoration fails

### **Key Functions Added:**

```typescript
// IndexedDB Operations
idbSave(key: string, blob: Blob): Promise<void>
idbLoad(key: string): Promise<Blob | null>
idbDelete(key: string): Promise<void>

// Enhanced State Management
loadStateFromStorage(): StoredDashboardState
saveStateToStorage(state: any): void

// Browser Navigation Events
handleBeforeUnload(event: BeforeUnloadEvent)
handlePopState(event: PopStateEvent)
```
